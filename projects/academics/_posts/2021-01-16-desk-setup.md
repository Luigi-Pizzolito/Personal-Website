For longer than I can believe I worked without a desk, alas it was more than overdue to have a workplace setup. Below is my desk!

With my 13.3" Mid-2014 Retina MacBook Pro being my main computer, I have it setup on top of a handy foldable laptop riser which conviniently keeps it at close to monitor height for decent ergonomics. Plugged into my Mac I have it's charger, wired gigabit ethernet through a thunderbolt adapter and a 4-port USB3 hub which lets me connect my other prehipherals; a RK68(RK855) RGB 68% mechanical keyboard (with brown switches), a Behringer U-Phoria UMC22 USB 2x2 audio interface, a Logitech M187 mini 2.4G wireless mouse (on a Western Digital mousepad) and a 3TB Western Digital Purple hard drive. To the left there is also my Bose QC35 II headphones, and my "Readless" brand bass guitar which sits on top of my single DIY studio monitor and Jamo SUB250 subwoofer; both of which are connected through my UMC22 audio interface. Behind my (50x80cm) table there is also a quite large 100x150cm white board, which comes in handy for putting up long-term to-do lists, magnetically hanging some photos, drawing diagrams and doing work.

The ehternet cable is routed to the other side of my room where goes to the top of my black cubpoard and connects to a FAST 5 port gigabit ethernet switch which connects to my router and my mini server project. On top of this cupboard also lives my 3D delta-printer, the Anycubic Kossel Mini, along with a record player and a XiaoMi 4-port usb charger which provides all sorts of charging cables to my bedside nightstand.
